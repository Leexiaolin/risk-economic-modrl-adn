This repository provides the simulation configuration files used in our paper:
“Risk-Economic Coordinated Control of Active Distribution Networks based on Multi-Objective Deep Reinforcement Learning”.
It includes modified IEEE 34-bus and IEEE 123-bus test systems, load uncertainty settings, PV/ESS (DER) deployment settings, solar irradiance data, and MODRL/D training hyperparameters.
